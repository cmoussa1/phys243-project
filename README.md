### Background

The housing market plays a crucial role in todayâ€™s national economy,
representing one of the most significant sectors in terms of financial
transactions and investment opportunities. The valuation and prediction of
housing prices have garnered significant attention from researchers,
policymakers, and real estate professionals, as it directly impacts numerous
stakeholders, including homeowners, buyers, sellers, investors, and government
institutions.

Being able to predict housing prices based on a number of factors using
historical data can effectively capture intricate relationships and identify
crucical factors influencing housing prices. In this project, we separate and
define these factors into two categories: **changeable features** (square
footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, number of stories, presence of a
guest room, central air conditioning, and furnishing status) and
**non-changeable features** (proximity to a main road, presence of a basement,
hot water heating, parking spaces, and preferred area status). These factors,
when analyzed, can help buyers make informed decisions.

### Implementation

This project looks to investigate the value increase associated with a number
of home improvement projects to help homeowners maximize their **return on**
**investment (ROI)**. It uses a [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harishkumardatalab/housing-price-prediction)
dataset along with a number of trusted articles to guage values and other
necessary information regarding home features and their relation to overall
home price.
